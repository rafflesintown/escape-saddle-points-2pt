# Code for ICML paper "Escaping Saddle Points in Zeroth-order Optimization: The Power of Two-point Estimators" by Zhaolin Ren, Yujie Tang and Na Li.

This code simulates the ZOPGD algorithm on a test octopus function (first proposed in "Gradient descent can take exponential time to escape saddle points" by Du et al) versus several alternative zeroth-order algorithms.
